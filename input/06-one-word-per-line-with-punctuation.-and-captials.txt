Hurray!
Capital
letters
have
arrived!
Don't
celebrate
too
soon.
But,
and
this
is
a
big
"but,"
what
happens
to
words
with
multiple
orthographical
appearances,
for
example:
you
You
YOU
me
Me
ME.
And
what
happens
to
words
like
us
and
US
when
the
capitalised
form
may
have
a
different
meaning?
Spoiler:
we
don't
care
about
that
for
this
assignment
:)
