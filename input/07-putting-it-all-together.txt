Finally!

We're putting it all together, so welcome to:
- lines with only one word
- blank lines
- blank lines at the end of the file
- lines with leading and trailing whitespace
- lines with multiple spaces between words
- words and wrods with spelling mistakes and spilling mis takes
  (you don't have to handle these as spelling mistakes, just as "genuine" words)

Don't celebrate too soon:  check how your processing is handling words
like "don't" to see how the punctuation is handled and how

You don't have to solve all these problems: just be aware of how
+--------------+
| entertaining |
+--------------+
input can be.

You DO NEED to handle basic situation of ignoring white space,
               no          matter         how          extreme
and deleting punctuation
AND handling words with different orthography for the same spelling.
Treat misspellings and new words.

Happy? :)

Best. File. Ever.
